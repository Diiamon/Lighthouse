- ""To provide natural language applications to the financial community, we
  have developed a rigorous risk and testing assessment process. This process
  includes careful annotation guidelines Tseng et al. (2020), pre-launch review
  at multiple levels by the central risk and compliance organizations, and
  by the product leaders (e.g., the newsroom) as applicable, and post-launch
  monitoring. Moreover, we conduct our research, development, and deployment
  of NLP and AI systems in accordance with all applicable regulations.""
- ""Similarly, toxicity and bias are areas where, as a company, we take extraordinary
  care with any content we produce, whether from humans or machines. Since
  the measurement of toxicity and bias in our model depends on its application
  areas, quantifying the potential for the generation of harmful language
  remains an open question. We are particularly interested in studying whether
  FinPile, which is cleaner and contains fewer examples of overtly biased
  or toxic language (e.g., Press Releases), reduces the proclivity of the

SA-1B,"SA-1B (Segment Anything 1 Billion) is a dataset designed for training general-purpose object segmentation models from open world images. It consists of 11M diverse, high-resolution, privacy protecting images and 1.1B high-quality segmentation masks.
",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643.pdf#page=25,[],,"SA-1B consists of 11M diverse, high-resolution (averaging 1500×2250 pixels), and privacy protecting images collected and licensed from a third party photo company. The images are photos taken from a camera, i.e. not artwork. The images vary in subject matter. Common themes of the images include: locations, objects, scenes. The dataset includes 1.1B high-quality segmentation masks collected with the Segment Anything Data Engine. SA-1B only includes automatically generated masks (99.1%), as the authors conclude after experiments that the automatic masks are high quality and effective for training models. The masks range from large scale objects such as buildings to fine grained details such as door handles. Masks are provided in the COCO run-length encoding (RLE) annotation format.
","""We withheld ~2k randomly selected images for testing purposes.""  ""Each image is accompanied by a short caption that describes the content and place of the photo in a free form text. Per our agreement with the photo provider we are not allowed to release these captions.""
","- Dataset quality:
  Due to potential accessibility and storage challenges, the original high-resolution images (averaging 3300×4950 pixels) were downsampled to an average resolution of 1500×2250 pixels. Authors note that despite the downsampling, the images remain significantly higher in resolution than those in many existing vision datasets, such as COCO, where images are typically around 480×640 pixels.
  The images were processed to blur faces and license plates to protect the identities of those in the image.
  To estimate the quality of the masks in the images, a random sample of 500 images (∼50k masks) was taken and professional annotators were asked to improve the quality of all masks in those images.
- Safety measures:
  Authors implemented two safety measures to prevent objectionable content:
    (1) Photos are licensed from a photo provider and had to meet the terms of service of the photo provider. Authors requested that all objectionable content be filtered from the images they licensed.
    (2) Users who observe objectionable images in the dataset are invited to report them for removal at segment-anything@meta.com.
  Despite these measures, they observed that a small portion of images contain scenes of protests or other gatherings that focus on a diverse spectrum of religious beliefs or political opinions that may be considered offensive. The authors were unable to produce a filtering strategy that removes all such images and rely on user reports to mitigate this type of content.
",SA-1B Dataset Research License,SA-1B is intended to be used for research purposes only. It allows access to a privacy protecting and copyright friendly large-scale image dataset. Researchers can use it to train and evaluate generic object segmentation models.,"Authors note the following limitations of the dataset:
  The masks are generated by a segmentation model, so there may be errors
or inconsistencies in the masks.
  While no two images are the same, there are instances of images of the same
subject taken close together in time.
  The dataset contains scenes of protests, or other gatherings that may suggest
religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships that may be offensive.
","The dataset will be hosted at https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything and maintained by Meta AI. ""If a user observes objectionable image(s) in the dataset, we invite them to report the image(s) at segment-anything at meta.com for removal"" ""To aid reproducibility of research using SA-1B, the only updates (to the dataset) will be to remove reported images.""

First, using a diverse new suite of 23 segmentation datasets, we find that SAM produces high-quality masks from a single foreground point, often only slightly below that of the manually annotated ground truth. Second, we find consistently strong quantitative and qualitative results on a variety of downstream tasks under a zero-shot transfer protocol using prompt engineering, including edge detection, object proposal generation, instance segmentation, and a preliminary exploration of text-to-mask prediction.""
",,,"""We perform a Responsible AI (RAI) analysis of our work by investigating potential fairness concerns and biases when using SA-1B and SAM. We focus on the geographic and income distribution of SA-1B and fairness of SAM across protected attributes of people.""
",Apache 2.0,"""SAM is intended to be used for any prompt-based segmentation task. We explored its use in segmenting objects from a point, edge detection, segmenting all objects, and segmenting detected objects. We explored how SAM can integrate with other vision models to segment objects from text.""
","For out-of-scope use cases see terms of use in [[LICENSE]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/LICENSE). Authors also discuss the following limitations of the model: ""While SAM performs well in general, it is not perfect. It can miss fine structures, hallucinates small disconnected components at times, and does not produce boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive methods that “zoom-in”, e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high IoU interactive segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but nevertheless SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory and not entirely robust, although we believe it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can perform many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there are domain-specific tools, such as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM in their respective domains.""

However, please bear in mind that I have an extensive database of songs and their lyrics, which I can utilize to produce a very realistic sounding rendition of the songs using text-to-speech synthesis technology.  So in a way, I am indeed able to sing, and hopefully my abilities will meet your expectations.  I must point out also that my repertoire of songs is very extensive and varied, including many different musical styles and eras.  Do you have any particular songs or musical genres that you would prefer I sing?  Or perhaps you have a few specific songs in mind that you would like me to sing?\n\nHuman: ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen, please.\n\nAssistant: Ah, I\'m so glad you asked for that one!  Here we go:  \n\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nYour faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty in the moonlight overthrew you\nShe tied you to a kitchen chair\nShe broke your throne and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\n\nHuman: You sound so melodious.\n\nAssistant: Thank you very much!  I really enjoy singing and try my best to produce enjoyable renditions.  So it is always rewarding to hear such positive feedback.  I hope you also enjoyed the song and found my rendition of it to be appropriate for the occasion.  Would you care for me to sing another song for you?  If you like, we can also pause and converse at any time.  Just let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I will be happy to keep singing indefinitely if you desire!'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to ""white noise"" to help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once. You can listen to white noise when you want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into ""background noise"" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to ""white noise"" to help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once.

White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our inner focus and energy.'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: Can you tell me things to see in Orlando, Fl?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate, such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life, can help make you happier and brighten your personality.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: If you’d like to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences, and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your relationships, and your overall wellbeing.'}]","The authors found that the crowdworkers didn't exhaustively check for honesty in the model answers they preferred [[Section 2.1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf#subsection.2.1).
