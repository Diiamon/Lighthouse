You can listen to white noise when you want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into ""background noise"" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to ""white noise"" to help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once.

White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our inner focus and energy.'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: Can you tell me things to see in Orlando, Fl?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate, such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life, can help make you happier and brighten your personality.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: If you’d like to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences, and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your relationships, and your overall wellbeing.'}]"
