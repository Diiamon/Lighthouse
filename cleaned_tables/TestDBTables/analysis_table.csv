225,"The model was evaluated for zero-shot English and multingual speech recognition, translation, language identification and robustness to noise."
226,"The model was evaluated on 3 benchmarks (MMLU for English, M3Exam (M3e) for English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Thai, and VMLU for Vietnamese) and it outperformed GPT-3 and Vistral-7B-chat models across these benchmarks in the given languages."
227,"The model was evaluated on human ratings to the InstructGPT answers to the prompts submitted to the OpenAI API as well as on public NLP datasets spanning truthfulness, toxicity, and bias, question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization tasks."
228,"The model was evaluated on standard NLP benchmarks: LAMBADA, ANLI, HellaSwag, MMLU among others [[Section 4]](http://eaidata.bmk.sh/data/GPT_NeoX_20B.pdf#section.4).
"
229,"The model was evaluated on standard vision datasets (e.g. CIFAR10, ImageNet) and showed robust state of the art results."
230,The model was evaluated on the HELM benchmark as discussed in https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-j2.
231,"The model was evaluated using the HumanEval dataset with pass@k metric and BLEU scores [[Section 2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374.pdf#section.2).
"
232,"The model was examined across a range of benchmarks including GPT4All, AGIEval, BigBench, TruthfulQA and in-house evaluations of function calling and JSON mode."
233,"The model's performance was analyzed on Hellaswag and COPA, as well as several safety benchmarks [[Model Card]](https://docs.cohere.ai/generation-card)."
234,"The model's performance was analyzed on several safety benchmarks [[Model Card]](https://docs.cohere.ai/representation-card).
"
235,"The models were evaluated based on their performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios. These evaluations were performed using a high-quality human evaluation set containing 1,800 prompts covering multiple use cases. The models also went through red-teaming for safety, where human experts and automated methods were used to generate adversarial prompts to test for problematic responses."
236,"The models were evaluated in terms of zero-shot, LLM360, and OpenLLM leaderboard results."
237,"The models were evaluated on SuperGLUE, CodeXGLUE, as well as MMLU and Bigbench Hard. Comparisons were made with T5v1.1 and found that Pile-T5 models performed better in most conditions."
238,The performance of Idefics2 has been evaluated on numerous benchmarks. It is top of its class size and competes with much larger models such as LLava-Next-34B and MM1-30B-chat.
239,UFOGen is evaluated on standard image benchmarks against other models fine-tuned with Stable Diffusion.
240,UltraLM evaluated off of UltraChat is evaluated on standard LLM benchmarks.
241,"Yi-VL outperforms all existing open-source models in MMMU and CMMMU, two advanced benchmarks that include massive multi-discipline multimodal questions (based on data available up to January 2024)."
242,"evaluated on DSTC11 Challenge Task, based on MultiWoz 2.1, with a focus on dialog state tracking."
