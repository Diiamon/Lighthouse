      "            \"description\": \"Meta on Tuesday announced the release of Llama 3.1, the latest version of its large language model that the company claims now rivals competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. The new model comes just three months after Meta launched Llama 3 by integrating it into Meta AI, a chatbot that now lives in Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and also powers the company's smart glasses. In the interim, OpenAI and Anthropic already released new versions of their own AI models, a sign that Silicon Valley\\u2019s AI arms race isn\\u2019t slowing down any time soon.In a blog post, Meta said that the new model, called Llama 3.1 405B, is the first openly available model that can compete available rivals in general knowledge, math skills and translating across multiple languages. The model was trained on more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, currently the fastest available chips that cost roughly $25,000 each, and can beat rivals on over 150 benchmarks, Meta claimed.The \\u201c405B\\u201d stands for 405 billion parameters, which are internal variables that an AI model uses to reason and make decisions. The higher the number of parameters an AI model has, the smarter we perceive it to be. OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4 model, by comparison, is reportedly has roughly 1.5 trillion parameters, although the company has not disclosed the number so far. In addition, Meta also released upgraded versions of existing Llama models that contain 70 billion and 8 billion parameters each, claiming that the newer versions had stronger reasoning abilities among other things.Developers can download Llama 3.1 from its official website, while regular users can play with it through Meta AI in WhatsApp or on meta.ai, the company\\u2019s website for its chatbot. \\u201cLlama 405B\\u2019s improved reasoning capabilities make it possible for Meta AI to understand and answer your more complex questions, especially on the topics of math and coding,\\u201d Meta\\u2019s blog post states. \\u201cYou can get help on your math homework with step-by-step explanations and feedback, write code faster with debugging support and optimization.\\u201d (Editor\\u2019s note: Engadget will pit Llama 3.1 against the New York Times Spelling Bee and report back to you). For now, Meta AI on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are still restricted to the smaller version of Llama 3.1 that uses 70 billion parameters.Unlike OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic that keep their AI models proprietary, Meta\\u2019s AI models are open source, which means that anyone can modify and use them for free and without sharing personal data with Meta. In a letter published on Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that an open source approach to AI development will ensure wider access to the technology\\u2019s benefits, prevent the concentration of power among a few big companies, and enable safer AI deployment across society. By open sourcing the company\\u2019s largest language model to date, Meta aims to make Llama the \\u201cindustry standard\\u201d for anyone to develop AI-powered apps and services with, Zuckerberg wrote.Open sourcing AI models and adding them to its existing products already used by billions of people could allow Meta to compete more effectively with OpenAI whose ChatGPT and DALL-E chatbots ignited an AI explosion when they launched in 2022. And it could also boost engagement \\u2014 Meta announced today that users would soon be able to add AI-generated images directly into feeds, stories, comments and messages across Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.In his letter, Zuckerberg also criticized Apple and its closed ecosystem, arguing that the iPhone maker\\u2019s restrictive and arbitrary policies had constrained what Meta could build on its platforms. \\u201c[It\\u2019s] clear that Meta and many other companies would be freed up to build much better services for people if we could build the best versions of our producers and competitors were not able to constrain what we could build,\\u201d he wrote.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/llama-31-is-metas-latest-salvo-in-the-battle-for-ai-dominance-150042924.html?src=rss\",\n",

Nearly a year later, Meta has announced a new round of features for its AI assistant and a fresh LLM to support it: Llama 3.1. These updates include an expansion of who can access Meta AI. Thanks to the addition of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Cameroon, the assistant is now available in 22 countries. It's also accessible in new languages: French, German, Hindi, Hindi-Romanized Script, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. However, some of the new features are location or language-specific for the time being. Meta is rolling out a beta tool called \\\"Imagine me\\\" throughout the US. It allows for prompts such as \\\"Imagine me surfing\\\" or \\\"Imagine me as a surrealist painting,\\\" and the AI assistant will create it using a photo of the individual. Meta is also adding new ways to tinker with an image, such as removing, changing or editing its content. This feature allows for creating an image, such as a duck, with the \\\"Imagine me\\\" tool and then instructing Meta AI to \\\"Change the duck to a cat.\\\" Next month there will also be an \\\"Edit with AI\\\" button for further fine-tuning of images. The company is also rolling out the ability to create an image with Meta AI in a feed, comment, story or message across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. It should roll out this week, though just in English for now.Then there's the launch of Llama 3.1 405B \\u2014 Meta's new open-source AI model. You can use it on WhatsApp or meta.ai for tasks such as answering math problems and coding. Meta claims it will update its AI technology every two weeks and that new features and languages are on the way.

      "            \"description\": \"Meta today released a trio of new open-source large language models called Llama 3.1, the largest of which may lead to new chatbots that rival ChatGPT. In fact, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes the company\\u2019s Llama powered AI assistant will be more widely used than ChatGPT by the end of this year. Llama 3.1 is actually a small family of models\\u2013Llama 3.1 405B, 70B, and 8B. (The numbers connote the number of parameters\\u2014that is, the neuron-like connection points where calculations are made and weights are applied\\u2014used by the models.) The 405B model was trained on a massive amount of data\\u201315 trillion tokens, which represent words or word-parts. The tokens represent web data dating to 2024 (earlier models have been limited in their recency by cut-off dates, sometimes years in the past).The 405B model was trained using 16,000 of NVIDIA\\u2019s H100 graphics processing units. State of the art \\u201cfrontier\\u201d models are trained by processing large amounts of web-scraped, licensed, or synthetically generated text and image data. The new models also have the ability to reach out to other models (via APIs) to tools and knowledge sources such as up-to-date information, math expertise, and coding. Developers can download the new Llama models from Meta or from Hugging Face, or access them via major cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Databricks.Meta calls the 405B version \\u201cthe world\\u2019s largest and most capable openly available foundation model.\\u201d The company says the model beats OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4 and GPT-4o, along with Anthropic\\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet on commonly used benchmark tests, and \\u201cis competitive with\\u201d those other models across a range of tasks. Meta believes developers will use its new Llama models to create more agentic chatbots, tools with greater reasoning capabilities, and better computer coding agents. The company also uses as examples of Llama 3.1 405B\\u2019s power the capacity for \\u201csynthetic data generation\\u201d and \\u201cmodel distillation.\\u201d The former means the ability of one large model to create training data for a smaller model. The latter means the ability of a large model (a \\u201cteacher\\u201d) to transfer elements of its intelligence to a smaller (\\u201cstudent\\u201d) model. Meta says it altered its commercial license agreement to allow for these uses. This could have important implications for how models work together, and economic implications for the return on investment of smaller models. But the model will also power some consumer use cases. It now powers Meta\\u2019s AI assistant at Meta.ai (for U.S. users, anyway) and within WhatsApp. The new models are text-based, not multimodal. But Zuckerberg says in a new video posted on Instagram that his company is working on next-gen models to power multimodal features such as an \\u201cImagine\\u201d feature that creates images based on a photo of a person and a prompt (for example, \\u201cImagine me playing soccer\\u201d). Zuckerberg says his company is also working on technology that will allow users to create their own AI apps and share them across the company\\u2019s social platforms. Over the past few years, as the AI race has heated up and attracted billions in investment dollars, companies have grown more and more secretive about how their models are built and how they work. Meta says it\\u2019s making the model weights publicly available through Hugging Face and a group of technology partners (including Nvidia), along with some new safety tools designed to make sure people don\\u2019t prompt the model to do harmful things. Open source advocates believe that AI can advance faster and better maintain safety if AI companies develop the burgeoning technology out in the open. Meta has long touted its commitment to open source, but many developers have noted that the company is open about some aspects of its models. \\u201cMeta is continuing the industry standard of open-washing in AI,\\u201d says Nathan Lambert, a machine learning expert who works at The Allen Institute for AI. Lambert says Zuckerberg and Meta\\u2019s definition of open-source differs in spirit from the major proposed definitions currently being debated by institutional working groups (which Meta participates in). Meta\\u2019s definition of \\u201copen\\u201d seems to permit a lack of information on the data used to train the models. The parameter weights (generated during the model\\u2019s pre-training) released with a model are important, but the substance and curation of the training data plays an equal role in the performance of the model, AI researchers have come to believe. \\u201cMeta\\u2019s release documents detail the data being \\u2018publicly available\\u2019 with no definition or documentation,\\u201d Lambert says. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang says his company, which produces and sculpts synthetic training data, provided a large amount of data used in the fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) of the new Llama models. Others say it\\u2019s the terms of Meta\\u2019s commercial usage license that fall short. \\u201cMeta isn\\u2019t open washing (per se) but Meta\\u2019s custom license and limits on usage does violate the ethos of open source,\\u201d Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran tells Fast Company in an email. Despite this, Chandrasekaran believes Llama 3.1 will have real impact for both businesses and consumers. \\u201c[T]his will be a very useful model to a large set of enterprise clients,\\u201d he says, \\u201cand we can also expect Meta to push AI features more aggressively in its consumer products.\\u201dThe big picture is that Meta is, first and foremost, a very rich social media company that makes its money selling ads within social feeds. It\\u2019s assembled an impressive organization of highly-paid AI researchers that can develop models that help with important parts of Meta\\u2019s business, such as content moderation. But it\\u2019s also in a position to seed the growing AI ecosystem with its free models and tools, which could benefit both Meta\\u2019s influence, and its bottom line, in the future.\",\n",

      "            \"description\": \"Meta on Tuesday announced the release of Llama 3.1, the latest version of its large language model that the company claims now rivals competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. The new model comes just three months after Meta launched Llama 3 by integrating it into Meta AI, a chatbot that now lives in Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and also powers the company's smart glasses. In the interim, OpenAI and Anthropic already released new versions of their own AI models, a sign that Silicon Valley\\u2019s AI arms race isn\\u2019t slowing down any time soon.In a blog post, Meta said that the new model, called Llama 3.1 405B, is the first openly available model that can compete available rivals in general knowledge, math skills and translating across multiple languages. The model was trained on more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, currently the fastest available chips that cost roughly $25,000 each, and can beat rivals on over 150 benchmarks, Meta claimed.The \\u201c405B\\u201d stands for 405 billion parameters, which are internal variables that an AI model uses to reason and make decisions. The higher the number of parameters an AI model has, the smarter we perceive it to be. OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4 model, by comparison, is reportedly has roughly 1.5 trillion parameters, although the company has not disclosed the number so far. In addition, Meta also released upgraded versions of existing Llama models that contain 70 billion and 8 billion parameters each, claiming that the newer versions had stronger reasoning abilities among other things.Developers can download Llama 3.1 from its official website, while regular users can play with it through Meta AI in WhatsApp or on meta.ai, the company\\u2019s website for its chatbot. \\u201cLlama 405B\\u2019s improved reasoning capabilities make it possible for Meta AI to understand and answer your more complex questions, especially on the topics of math and coding,\\u201d Meta\\u2019s blog post states. \\u201cYou can get help on your math homework with step-by-step explanations and feedback, write code faster with debugging support and optimization.\\u201d (Editor\\u2019s note: Engadget will pit Llama 3.1 against the New York Times Spelling Bee and report back to you). For now, Meta AI on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are still restricted to the smaller version of Llama 3.1 that uses 70 billion parameters.Unlike OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic that keep their AI models proprietary, Meta\\u2019s AI models are open source, which means that anyone can modify and use them for free and without sharing personal data with Meta. In a letter published on Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that an open source approach to AI development will ensure wider access to the technology\\u2019s benefits, prevent the concentration of power among a few big companies, and enable safer AI deployment across society. By open sourcing the company\\u2019s largest language model to date, Meta aims to make Llama the \\u201cindustry standard\\u201d for anyone to develop AI-powered apps and services with, Zuckerberg wrote.Open sourcing AI models and adding them to its existing products already used by billions of people could allow Meta to compete more effectively with OpenAI whose ChatGPT and DALL-E chatbots ignited an AI explosion when they launched in 2022. And it could also boost engagement \\u2014 Meta announced today that users would soon be able to add AI-generated images directly into feeds, stories, comments and messages across Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.In his letter, Zuckerberg also criticized Apple and its closed ecosystem, arguing that the iPhone maker\\u2019s restrictive and arbitrary policies had constrained what Meta could build on its platforms. \\u201c[It\\u2019s] clear that Meta and many other companies would be freed up to build much better services for people if we could build the best versions of our producers and competitors were not able to constrain what we could build,\\u201d he wrote.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/llama-31-is-metas-latest-salvo-in-the-battle-for-ai-dominance-150042924.html?src=rss\",\n",
